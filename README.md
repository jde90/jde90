## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 6.3h | 39.9h | 129h | ~1924h* |
| Interactive human attention | 4.1h | 33.3h | 119.3h | 237.1h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.4h | 21.8h | 116.8h | 366.7h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 0.2h | 1.9h | 21.4h | 53.4h |
| Additive observed work | 6.8h | 57.0h | 257.5h | 657.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 10 | 28 | 88 | 175 |
| Worker sessions | 38 | 157 | 721 | 1,568 |

_Screen time from macos-knowledge-db:/app/usage-union; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 62 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
