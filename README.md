## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 5.3h | 16.2h | 115.3h | ~1787h* |
| Interactive human attention | 5.0h | 11.9h | 100.2h | 244.9h |
| Interactive AI generation | 6.6h | 12.4h | 95.6h | 376.6h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 0.1h | 0.6h | 9.3h | 53.8h |
| Additive observed work | 11.7h | 24.9h | 205.1h | 675.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 6 | 20 | 85 | 185 |
| Worker sessions | 24 | 147 | 607 | 1,677 |

_Screen time from macos-knowledge-db:/app/usage-union; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 68 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
