## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 3.2h | 15.6h | 112h | ~1784h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.5h | 11.5h | 96.5h | 240.0h |
| Interactive AI generation | 3.1h | 8.4h | 90.3h | 370.0h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 0.1h | 0.6h | 9.2h | 53.8h |
| Additive observed work | 5.7h | 20.6h | 196.1h | 663.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 13 | 24 | 83 | 183 |
| Worker sessions | 23 | 145 | 585 | 1,655 |

_Screen time from macos-knowledge-db:/app/usage-union; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 67 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
