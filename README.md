## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 4.8h | 38.5h | 131.1h | ~1917h* |
| Interactive human attention | 4.6h | 33.0h | 116.4h | 233.1h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.7h | 25.7h | 117.3h | 364.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 0.1h | 2.1h | 23.6h | 53.2h |
| Additive observed work | 7.4h | 60.7h | 257.3h | 650.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 12 | 29 | 85 | 171 |
| Worker sessions | 31 | 151 | 735 | 1,541 |

_Screen time from macos-knowledge-db:/app/usage-union; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 61 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
